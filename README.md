Project: 2D Top-Down Racing Game

Description:

This project is a 2D top-down racing game developed in C++ with object-oriented programming principles. Players control vehicles using arrow keys and keyboard inputs. The game features realistic vehicle physics with acceleration and inertia, providing an immersive racing experience. An intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) allows players to select the number of players and choose their vehicle. Additionally, there is a mode where players can engage in direct combat against AI-controlled robots.

Features:
